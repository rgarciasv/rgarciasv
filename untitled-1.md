**How is your** [**DNA**](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/dna) **organized?**

Your [DNA](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/dna) is organized into [chromosomes](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/chromosomes), the pink structures pictured above. Your DNA doesn't always look so pretty, though. It only winds tightly into chromosomes when the cell is getting ready to divide. If your DNA wasn't organized into chromosomes, your DNA would look like a mass of strings and would be difficult to divide up!

#### Mitosis and Chromosomes <a id="x-ck12-TWl0b3NpcyBhbmQgQ2hyb21vc29tZXM."></a>

The genetic information of the cell, or [DNA](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/dna), is stored in the **nucleus**. During **mitosis**, two nuclei \(plural for [nucleus](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/nucleus)\) must form, so that one nucleus can be in each of the new [cells](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cells) after the cell divides. In order to create two genetically identical nuclei, DNA inside of the nucleus must be copied or replicated. This occurs during the S phase of the [cell cycle](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cell-cycle). During mitosis, the copied DNA is divided into two complete sets, so that after **cytokinesis**, each cell has a complete set of genetic instructions.

**Chromosomes**

To begin mitosis, the DNA in the [nucleus](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/nucleus) wraps around [proteins](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/proteins) to form **chromosomes**. Each organism has a unique number of [chromosomes](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/chromosomes). In human [cells](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cells), our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical **sister chromatids**, forming an "X" shaped molecule \(**Figure** [below](https://www.ck12.org/c/life-science/mitosis/lesson/Mitosis-and-Cytokinesis-MS-LS/?referrer=concept_details#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wMy1jaHJvbW9zb21lcw..)\). The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the **centromere**. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The **spindles** separate sister chromatids from each other.

![How DNA coils to make a chromosome](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A7ad434ea1dd3bbe0ede0e95cf8810897e6b1895f9cc9f857e36155fc%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1)

The DNA double helix wraps around [proteins](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/proteins) \(2\) and tightly coils a number of times to form a chromosome \(5\). This figure shows the complexity of the coiling process. The red dot shows the [location](https://www.ck12.org/c/earth-science/location) of the centromere, which holds the sister chromatids together and is where the spindle microtubules attach during mitosis and [meiosis](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/meiosis). Notice that a chromosome resembles an "X."\[Figure2\]

**Four Phases of Mitosis**

During mitosis, the two sister chromatids must be divided. This is a precise process that has four individual phases to it. After the sister chromatids separate, each separate chromatid is now known as a chromosome. Each resulting chromosome is made of DNA from just one chromatid. So, each chromosome after this separation is made of "1/2 of the X." Through this process, each daughter cell receives one copy of each chromosome. The four phases of mitosis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase \(**Figure** [below](https://www.ck12.org/c/life-science/mitosis/lesson/Mitosis-and-Cytokinesis-MS-LS/?referrer=concept_details#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wNC1taXRvc2lzLWZsb3djaGFydA..)\).

1. **Prophase**: The chromatin, which is unwound DNA, condenses forming [chromosomes](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/chromosomes). The DNA becomes so tightly wound that you can see them under a microscope. The membrane around the [nucleus](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/nucleus), called the nuclear envelope, disappears. Spindles also form and attach to chromosomes to help them move.
2. **Metaphase**: The chromosomes line up in the center, or the equator, of the cell. The chromosomes line up in a row, one on top of the next.
3. **Anaphase**: The two sister chromatids of each chromosome separate as the spindles pull the chromatids apart, resulting in two sets of identical chromosomes.
4. **Telophase**: The spindle dissolves and nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in both [cells](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cells).

![An overview of the cell cycle and mitosis](https://dr282zn36sxxg.cloudfront.net/datastreams/f-d%3A2611548d82f15409dfa0558a89cb81ae4ac2f4853857993918f39514%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY%2BIMAGE_THUMB_POSTCARD_TINY.1)

An overview of the [cell cycle](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cell-cycle) and mitosis: during prophase the chromosomes condense, during metaphase the chromosomes line up, during anaphase the sister chromatids are pulled to opposite sides of the cell, and during telophase the nuclear envelope forms.\[Figure3\]

After telophase, each new nucleus contains the exact same number and type of chromosomes as the original cell. The cell is now ready for cytokinesis, which literally means "cell movement." During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm divides and the parent cell separates, producing two genetically identical cells, each with its own nucleus. A new [cell membrane](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cell-membrane) forms and in plant cells, a cell wall forms as well. Below is a representation of dividing plant cells \(**Figure** [below](https://www.ck12.org/c/life-science/mitosis/lesson/Mitosis-and-Cytokinesis-MS-LS/?referrer=concept_details#x-ck12-TVNMUy0wNS0wNS1wbGFudC1jZWxsLWRpdmlzaW9u)\).

This is a representation of dividing plant cells. [Cell division](https://www.ck12.org/c/biology/cell-division) in plant cells differs slightly from animal cells as a cell wall must form. Note that most of the cells are in interphase. Can you find examples of the different stages of mitosis?\[Figure4\]
